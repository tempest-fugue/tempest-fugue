# Eric MacDougall

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eric MacDougall.

I am a data scientist with a passion for programming, machine learning, and data analysis. I am adept at harnessing data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency, identify growth opportunities, and refine business processes. Skilled in translating complex data sets into actionable strategies, I'm passionate about aiding organizations in making well-informed, future-oriented decisions. I thrive in collaborative settings and remain dedicated to keeping up with the latest trends in data science. I am always eager to apply my expertise and make a significant impact in meaningful ventures.

In my free time I work on and review code for the [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) and its attempts to unroll/read 2,000 year old scrolls, I work on an Arthurian horror video game using Blender and Unreal Engine, and exploring how [digital methods and technologies are changing and challenging medieval scholarship](https://codingcodices.wordpress.com/).
